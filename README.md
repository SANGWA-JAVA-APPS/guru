Code Generator  v.0.0.1
Overview: The Code Generator (v1) is a Java Spring Boot application designed to streamline the development process by enabling users to generate fully functional Spring Boot CRUD code in just a minute. The tool is ideal for developers who want to quickly create a backend without manually writing repetitive boilerplate code. (This is only backend)

Key Features:

Entity and Relationship Input:

Users provide the entities (tables) and their relationships (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) through a simple interface.
The application automatically generates entity classes, repositories, service layers, and REST controllers based on this input.
CRUD Operations:

The generated code includes all necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity, allowing immediate interaction with the database.
The code adheres to Spring Boot best practices, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.
Instant Code Generation:

With just a few clicks, the user can generate a complete Spring Boot project, reducing hours of manual coding to mere minutes.
The generated project is ready to run, with configurations set up for easy deployment.
Direct Download:

Once the code is generated, users can directly download the complete Spring Boot project as a ZIP file. The project is immediately runnable, allowing developers to start the application without any additional setup.
Scalability:

The tool is designed to handle projects of varying complexity, from simple single-entity applications to complex systems with multiple interconnected entities.
Customization:

Users can customize aspects of the generated code, such as naming conventions, package structure, and additional configurations like pagination or sorting.
Intended Use:

This version of the Code Generator is perfect for developers who need to quickly prototype applications, create boilerplate code for larger projects, or learn about Spring Boot's structure and best practices. It's especially useful in scenarios where time is of the essence, and rapid development is required.
